TODO:
Create more implemenation for the artist page, currently what we have is a good basis for a web app for people to sign on to and create events and such, basically more like a management app.
We could create a separation between the home page and when someone clicks events or artists. There should be a differantiation between what an admin can do and what a user can do.

# 1: Seperation Between Admin Web Page and User Web Page

# 2: Admin; Adding Artist
- This should have the same implementation as the events page, making it simple to add and artist picture, bio, and shows that are realted to the events, one artist can have many shows

# 3: Login Page
- This could be used to differantiate between a user signing in and an admin. The defualt should be the user page without logging in. When clicking on the login page an admin would enter their credentials and be able to see the add events add artist features that we have now.
